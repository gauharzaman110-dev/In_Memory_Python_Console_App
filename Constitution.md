# Project Constitution

## Name
Todo In-Memory Python Console App

## Version
1.0.0 (Phase I)

## Mission
To develop a foundational command-line interface (CLI) application that allows users to manage a list of tasks (todos) stored entirely in memory. This project serves as the initial phase in a larger initiative to build progressively complex software systems.

## Vision
To provide a simple, intuitive, and robust in-memory todo application that adheres to clean code principles and serves as a stepping stone for future enhancements and architectural evolution.

## Core Values

### 1. Simplicity
- Prioritize clear, straightforward code and user interactions.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity in design and implementation.

### 2. Functionality
- Ensure all specified features (Add, Delete, Update, View, Mark Complete) are fully implemented and thoroughly tested.
- Focus on delivering a reliable and usable product.

### 3. Clean Code
- Adhere to Python best practices, including PEP 8 guidelines.
- Write readable, maintainable, and well-structured code.
- Implement proper project structure and modular design.

### 4. User-Centric Design
- Design the CLI interface to be intuitive and easy for end-users to understand and operate.
- Provide clear feedback for all user actions.

### 5. Iterative Development
- Embrace an iterative approach, building functionality step-by-step.
- Be open to refinement and improvement based on feedback and evolving requirements.

## Scope (Phase I)

### Inclusions:
- Core CRUD operations for todo items (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Ability to mark tasks as "completed" or "pending".
- In-memory data storage (no persistence to disk).
- Command-line interface for all interactions.
- Basic error handling for user input and invalid commands.

### Exclusions:
- Data persistence (e.g., saving to file, database).
- Advanced search or filtering capabilities.
- User authentication or multi-user support.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI).
- Network capabilities or API integrations.

## Stakeholders
- Users: Individuals who need a simple command-line todo management tool.
- Developers: Contributors to the project, maintaining and extending the codebase.
- Product Architects: Guiding the project's evolution and ensuring alignment with the overall vision.

## Communication
- All major design decisions and architectural changes will be documented.
- Code will be reviewed for adherence to standards and quality.

## Definition of Done (Phase I)
- All 5 basic level features are implemented.
- The application runs successfully as a console application.
- Code adheres to clean code principles and proper Python project structure.
- `README.md`, `gemini.md`, and `Constitution.md` are present and up-to-date.
- `specs_history` directory is created.

# Gemini Code Instructions

This document outlines how Gemini was used in the development of this project.

## Phase I: Todo In-Memory Python Console App

Gemini assisted in:
- Generating the initial project structure and boilerplate code.
- Developing the `Todo` class (in `src/todo.py`) for task representation.
- Implementing the `TodoManager` class (in `src/todo_manager.py`) to handle in-memory CRUD operations for todos.
- Creating the command-line interface (CLI) logic (in `src/cli.py`) for user interaction.
- Setting up the main application entry point (in `main.py`).
- Generating `README.md` with setup and usage instructions.
- Creating placeholder files like `requirements.txt`, `Constitution.md`, and the `specs_history` directory.

The code was developed iteratively, with Gemini providing the core logic and structure for each component based on the project requirements.
